# Next.js Product Filters Project

Welcome to the Next.js Product Filters Project! This project is created for learning purposes and serves as an example of building a product filtering system using query params for enhanced SEO and better overview of what is being searched for.

## Technologies Used

- **Shadcn UI**: A UI library for building responsive and accessible user interfaces.
- **Tanstack Query**: A powerful data-fetching library for managing server state in React applications.
- **DALL-E**: Used to generate the hero image and favicon for the project, leveraging OpenAI's image generation capabilities.
- **Fake Store API**: A free API providing fake data for testing and prototyping e-commerce applications. This project uses it to fetch product data.

## Features

- **Product Filters**: Users can filter products by search term, category, price, rating, and sorting options.
